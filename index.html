        <h1>Bushfires in Australia</h1>
        <p>This page provides an overview of bushfires that have occurred 
          in Australia during the 2019-20 bushfire season, which has also 
          colloquially been referred to as “Black Summer”, before exploring 
          how climate change may have exacerbated the scale of the bushfires.</p>

          <h3>Impact of Bushfires on Australian Land Area</h3>
          <p>This map illustrates the amount of land that was burnt in 
            each state and territory during the season. This has been 
            normalised using the area of each state to provide a percentage 
            of the land burnt. A slider has been provided to allow filtering 
            of states and territories based on the percentage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the visualisation, the most affected state or territory 
            was the Australian Capital Territory where over a third of the 
            territory's land area was burnt during the bushfire season. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="description-left" style="margin-left: 30px; padding-top: 65px;">
          <p>The 
            scale of the damage to the land was substantially more detrimental 
            compared to the other states and territories where the next most 
            affected states were New South Wales and Victoria, which only 
            sustained approximately 6% of damage of the states’ land.
            </p>
            <p> In contrast, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania had 
              less than 1% of their land area that was affected by the bushfires 
              in the 2020-21 bushfire season.

        <div class="vis-container" style="margin-right: 120px; padding-top: 50px;">
    
          <p>The stacked bar chart provides further insight into the 
            distribution of the damage over the months. For New South 
            Wales, Northern Territory and Western Australia, there was 
            an even distribution with a consistent amount of area being 
            burnt over the season.

          </p>
          <p> In contrast, the remaining states and territories either 
            experienced damage throughout a shorter time period as
            illustrated by Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, 
            or experienced a strong skew as illustrated by Victoria, where 
            most of the damage was sustained in the first two months.
            </p>
            <p> Together with the map, this chart acts to establish that all of the states and territories 
              were impacted by the fires to differing degrees and at differing 
              timeframes.
            
              </p>
            <p> Please note: The chart has not been normalised like the map as it aims to 
              illustrate the distribution of the total dmanage sustained by 
              month. Therefore, while it appears that the Northern Territory 
              sustained the most of damage, due to the scale of the territory’s 
              land area, this only amounted to 5% of the land being affected.

        <h2>Changes in Climate over the years in Australia</h2>
        <p>Climate change has had a strong impact on many aspects of bushfires such as their frequency and intensity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, the increased average temperature of the globe, in tandem with decreased rainfall have acted to 
          exacerbate the dry seasons experienced by areas that have historically been susceptible to bushfires.
          </p>
        <p>
          Below, the key climate factors that have been explored include temperature and rainfall.

        <p> From 2010 onwards, there have been more instances of extreme heat such 
             as in the case of 2019 and 2022 where there were numerous occurrences 
             of the mean maximum temperatures of a state or territory exceeding 35 
             degrees celsius. A similar trend can be observed in min temperature.

        In terms of how the temperature may have affected the Black
        Summer, Australian Capital Territory had a consistent average 
        maximum temperature of 31.6 degrees for 3 consecutive months 
        between the period of December 2019 and February 2020. This 
        extended period of extreme heat coincided with the peak damage 
        sustained by the territory during the bushfire season, where over

      30% of its area was affected by the bushfires as visible in the map 
      above. This is bolstered by the fact that most of the damage was 
      sustained in February 2020. This effectively highlights how the 
      sustained extreme temperatures were a key factor that contributed 
      to the devastating bushfire season. </p>

          <p> As seen in the heatmap, with the exception of February 
            2022 which was an outlier, overall the average rainfall 
            has decreased in most states, notably in the last 5 years.

        <p> 
          In terms of how the rainfall may have affected the Black
        Summer, in December 2019, Australia only had an average of 
      21.69mm of rainfall despite having 64.21mm in 2018 and 99.31mm 
      in 2017.

        <p> 
          The reduced rainfall in 2019, resulted in the notably dry 
          season which would have contributed to the circumstances 
          leading up to Black Summer as it would have allowed the 
          fires to spark and travel more easily.

        Based on the insights gained above, it was evident that the 
        devastating reach of 2019-20 bushfires was not by coincidence, 
        but rather was due to an accumulation of changes to Australia’s 
        weather and environment as a result of climate change.</p>
