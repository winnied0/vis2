          <h3>Impact of Bushfires on Australian Land Area</h3>
          <p>This map illustrates the amount of land that was burnt
            in each state and territory during the 2020-21 bushfire season. 
            This has been normalised using the area of each state 
            to provide a percentage of the land burnt. </p>
            
            <p> Based on the visualisation, the most affected state or territory 
            was the Australian Capital Territory where over a third of the 
            territory's land area was burnt during the bushfire season. The 
            scale of the damage to the land was substantially more detrimental 
            compared to the other states and territories where the next most 
            affected states were New South Wales and Victoria, which only 
            sustained approximately 6% of damage of the state's land. </p>

            <p>
              In contrast, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania had less
              than 1% of their land area that was affected by the bushfires in the 
              2020-21 bushfire season.

        <h2>Changes in Climate over the years in Australia</h2>
        <p>Climate change has had a strong impact on many aspects of bushfires such as their frequency and intensity. 
        For instance, the increased average temperature of the globe, in tandem with decrease rainfall have acted to 
        exacerbate the dry seasons experienced by areas that have historically been suspectible to bushfires.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, the key climate factors that have been explored include temperature and rainfall.

        <h3>Impact of Climate Change on Temperature</h3>
        <p>The two line charts represents the monthly average maximum and minimum temperature 
          of each state and territory in Australia between the period of 2000-2023.</p>

          <p>
            Overall, between the period of 2000-2023, the mean maximum temperature has remained 
            rather consistent, however, in recent years, there have been more instances of extreme 
            heat such as in the case of 2019 and 2022 where there were instances of the mean maximum 
            temperatures of a state or territory exceeding 35 degrees celsius. 

            A similar trend can be observed in the mean minimum temperature. However, it is worth noting that 
            the mean minimum temperature has a higher variance between each state unlike the maximum temperature.
